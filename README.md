# YOLO-object-detection-Pi4
This project is about an automated and remote-controlled car system that leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection. This system allows for both autonomous and manual control via remote access, making it ideal for experimentation and research in automated driving technologies.
